- If a player cannot play a card, they must draw a card from the deck
- Special cards have unique effects:
  - **Number cards (0-9)**: Regular play
  - **Skip**: The next player loses their turn
  - **Reverse**: The direction of play changes
  - **Draw 2**: The next player draws 2 cards and loses their turn
  - **Wild**: The player chooses the next color to be played
  - **Wild Draw 4**: The player chooses the next color, and the next player draws 4 cards and loses their turn
